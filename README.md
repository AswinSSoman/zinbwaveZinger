# ZINB-WaVE / zingeR

I propose this repository for our collaboration on the ZINB-WaVE-zingeR paper.

The new zingeR simulations have been uploaded, accompanied with the analyses performed leading to the figures for the slides that we have shown during our first Skype talk. I have commented code used for the bioRxiv paper that was not used in the ZINB-WaVE evaluations, but it is still there in case you would like to have a look at more in-depth evaluations. 

Please let me know if you want me to send/upload particular R objects, datasets, or if you think something is not right by either raising an issue or e-mailing to koen.vandenberge@ugent.be
